This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

Below you'll find information about performing common tasks. The most recent version of this guide is available [here](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/react-native-scripts/template/README.md).

For timers, this project also uses [react-native-stopwatch-timer](https://github.com/michaeljstevens/react-native-stopwatch-timer).

Right now this project only runs on Expo when I build it locally. Once I get it working entirely on Expo, I'll experiment with building it into Android and iOS apps, respectively.
